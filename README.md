# üé∞ Spawn 'em all!

The goal of this project is to explore and analyze the underlying mechanisms behind the generative model used in Pok√©mon Go to determine Pok√©mon spawns.
The project focuses on investigating how real-world factors, such as weather and location, influence the spawning of Pok√©mon, as well as the relationships between the attributes of Pok√©mon and their spawning patterns.  

## üìä Dataset

The dataset consists of 300,000 observations collected worldwide during August 2016. Each observation includes:  

- **Pok√©mon ID**: A unique identifier for the spawned Pok√©mon (nominal variable with 150 possible values).  
- **Geolocation**: Latitude and longitude coordinates indicating where the Pok√©mon spawned.
- **Local Timestamp**: The time and date of the spawn event.  

Using these primary variables, additional derived variables were created to enrich the analysis:  

- **Weather conditions**.  
- **Day/night cycle** and seasonal changes.  
- **Proximity to specific geographical features** (e.g., rivers, lakes).  
- **Urban vs. rural context**.  

## üîß Models families

1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**  
  - **Objective**: Reduce the dimensionality of Pok√©mon features and simplify multivariate analysis.  
  - **Findings**: Two and three components were tested, but the results were inconclusive due to low explained variance (Kaiser criterion not met).  

2. **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**  
  - **Objective**: Group Pok√©mon based on their attributes and identify outliers.  
  - **Findings**: Clusters were not homogeneous, and the noise cluster was excessively large, even with adjustments to the radius (epsilon) parameter.  

3. **Logistic Regression (Bootstrapped)**  
  - **Objective**: Link specific real-world variables (e.g., proximity to water) to the spawn frequency of Pok√©mon types.  
  - **Findings**: Demonstrated that certain Pok√©mon types, such as water-related Pok√©mon, are more likely to spawn near water-related venues.

4. **Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA)**
  - **Objective**: Analyze and visualize relationships between nominal categorical variables.
  - **Outcome**: Helped to identify patterns and correlations between different nominal features, such as the tendency of fire Pok√©mon to spawn during cold nights in rural areas.

5. **Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)**
  - **Objective**: Explore relationships between two sets of continuous variables.
  - **Outcome**: Despite concerns about the normality of distances, CCA revealed interesting correlations, such as the spawning of fire Pok√©mon in colder temperatures.
